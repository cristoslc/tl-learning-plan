description: Task tracking and implementation execution for swain projects. Invoke whenever a SPEC needs an implementation plan, the user asks what to work on next, wants to check or update task status, claim or close tasks, manage dependencies, or abandon work. Also invoked by swain-design after creating a SPEC that's ready for implementation. Tracks SPECs and SPIKEs — not EPICs, VISIONs, or JOURNEYs directly (those get decomposed into SPECs first).

# Execution Tracking

<!-- session-check: SPEC-121 -->
Before proceeding with any state-changing operation, check for an active session:
```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
bash "$REPO_ROOT/.agents/bin/swain-session-check.sh" 2>/dev/null
```
If the JSON output has `"status"` other than `"active"`, inform the operator: "No active session — start one with `/swain-session`?" Proceed if they dismiss.

Abstraction layer for agent execution tracking. Other skills (e.g., swain-design) express intent using abstract terms; this skill translates that intent into concrete CLI commands.

**Before first use:** Read [references/tk-cheatsheet.md](references/tk-cheatsheet.md) for complete command syntax, flags, ID formats, and anti-patterns.

## Artifact handoff protocol

This skill receives handoffs from swain-design based on a four-tier tracking model:

| Tier | Artifacts | This skill's role |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Implementation** | SPEC | Create a tracked implementation plan and task breakdown before any code is written |
| **Coordination** | EPIC, VISION, JOURNEY | Do not track directly — swain-design decomposes these into children first, then hands off the children |
| **Research** | SPIKE | Create a tracked plan when the research is complex enough to benefit from task breakdown |
| **Reference** | ADR, PERSONA, RUNBOOK | No tracking expected |

If invoked directly on a coordination-tier artifact (EPIC, VISION, JOURNEY) without prior decomposition, defer to swain-design to create child SPECs first, then create plans for those children.

## Term mapping

Other skills use these abstract terms. This skill maps them to the current backend (`tk`):

| Abstract term | Meaning | tk command |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| **implementation plan** | Top-level container grouping all tasks for a spec artifact | `tk create "Title" -t epic --external-ref <SPEC-ID>` |
| **task** | An individual unit of work within a plan | `tk create "Title" -t task --parent <epic-id>` |
| **origin ref** | Immutable link from a plan to the spec that seeded it | `--external-ref <ID>` flag on epic creation |
| **spec tag** | Mutable tag linking a task to every spec it affects | `--tags spec:<ID>` on create |
| **dependency** | Ordering constraint between tasks | `tk dep <child> <parent>` (child depends on parent) |
| **ready work** | Unblocked tasks available for pickup | `tk ready` |
| **claim** | Atomically take ownership of a task | `tk claim <id>` |
| **complete** | Mark a task as done | `tk add-note <id> "reason"` then `tk close <id>` |
| **abandon** | Close a task that will not be completed | `tk add-note <id> "Abandoned: <why>"` then `tk close <id>` |
| **escalate** | Abandon + invoke swain-design to update upstream artifacts | Abandon, then invoke swain-design skill |

## Configuration and bootstrap

Config stored in `.agents/execution-tracking.vars.json` (created on first run). Read [references/configuration.md](references/configuration.md) for first-run setup questions, config keys, and the 6-step bootstrap workflow.

## Statuses

tk accepts exactly three status values: `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`. Use the `status` command to set arbitrary statuses, but the dependency graph (`ready`, `blocked`) only evaluates these three.

To express abandonment, use `tk add-note <id> "Abandoned: ..."` then `tk close <id>` — see [Escalation](#escalation).

## Ticket lifecycle (ADR-015)

Tickets are **ephemeral execution scaffolding** — they exist to help agents track and resume work during SPEC implementation. Once the parent SPEC transitions to a terminal state (Complete, Abandoned), its tickets may be discarded. Tickets are not committed to trunk, not used as retro evidence, and should not block worktree cleanup. The session log (`.agents/session.json` JSONL) is the archival record of what happened; tickets are the live dashboard of what's in progress.

## Operating rules

1. **Always include `--description`** (or `-d`) when creating issues — a title alone loses the "why" behind a task. Future agents (or your future self) picking up this work need enough context to act without re-researching.
2. Create/update tasks at the start of work, after each major milestone, and before final response — this keeps the tracker useful as a live dashboard rather than a post-hoc record.
3. Keep task titles short and action-oriented — they appear in `tk ready` output, tree views, and notifications where space is limited.
4. Store handoff notes using `tk add-note <id> "context"` rather than ephemeral chat context — chat history is lost between sessions, but task notes persist and are visible to any agent or observer.
5. Include references to related artifact IDs in tags (e.g., `spec:SPEC-003`) — this enables querying all work touching a given spec.
6. **Prefix abandonment reasons with `Abandoned:`** when closing incomplete tasks — this convention makes abandoned work findable so nothing silently disappears.
7. **Use `ticket-query` for structured output** — when you need JSON for programmatic use, pipe through `ticket-query` (available in the vendored `bin/` directory) instead of parsing human-readable output. Example: `ticket-query '.status == "open"'`

## TDD enforcement

Strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with anti-rationalization safeguards and completion verification. Read [references/tdd-enforcement.md](references/tdd-enforcement.md) for the anti-rationalization table, task ordering rules, and evidence requirements.

## Spec lineage tagging

Use `--external-ref SPEC-NNN` on plan epics (immutable origin) and `--tags spec:SPEC-NNN` on child tasks (mutable). Query: `ticket-query '.tags and (.tags | contains("spec:SPEC-003"))'`. Cross-plan links: `tk link <task-a> <task-b>`.

## Escalation

When work cannot proceed as designed, abandon tasks and escalate to swain-design. Read [references/escalation.md](references/escalation.md) for the triage table, abandonment commands, escalation workflow, and cross-spec handling.

## "What's next?" flow

Run `tk ready` for unblocked tasks and `ticket-query '.status == "in_progress"'` for in-flight work. If `.tickets/` is empty or missing, defer to `bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.agents/bin/chart.sh" ready` for artifact-level guidance.

## Context on claim

When claiming a task tagged with `spec:<ID>`, show the Vision ancestry breadcrumb to provide strategic context. Run `bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.agents/bin/chart.sh" scope <SPEC-ID> 2>/dev/null | head -5` to display the parent chain. This tells the agent/operator how the current task connects to project strategy.

## Artifact/tk reconciliation

When specwatch detects mismatches (`TK_SYNC`, `TK_ORPHAN` in `.agents/specwatch.log`), read [references/reconciliation.md](references/reconciliation.md) for the mismatch types, resolution commands, and reconciliation workflow.

## Session bookmark

After state-changing operations, update the bookmark: `bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.agents/bin/swain-bookmark.sh" "<action> <task-description>"`

## Superpowers skill chaining

When superpowers is installed, swain-do invokes these skills at specific points. Skipping them or inlining the work undermines the guarantees they provide — TDD catches regressions before they compound, and verification prevents false completion claims that waste downstream effort:

1. **Before writing code for any task:** Invoke the `test-driven-development` skill. Write a failing test first (RED), then make it pass (GREEN), then refactor. This applies to every task, not just the first one.

2. **When dispatching parallel work:** Invoke `subagent-driven-development` (if subagents are available and tasks are independent) or `executing-plans` (if serial). Read [references/execution-strategy.md](references/execution-strategy.md) for the decision tree.

3. **Before claiming any task or plan is complete:** Invoke `verification-before-completion`. Run the verification commands, read the output, and only then assert success. No completion claims without fresh evidence.

**Detection:** `ls .agents/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md .claude/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null` — if at least one path exists, superpowers is available. Cache the result for the session.

When superpowers is NOT installed, swain-do uses its built-in TDD enforcement (see [references/tdd-enforcement.md](references/tdd-enforcement.md)) and serial execution.

## Plan ingestion (superpowers integration)

When a superpowers plan file exists, use the ingestion script (`scripts/ingest-plan.py`) instead of manual task decomposition. Read [references/plan-ingestion.md](references/plan-ingestion.md) for usage, format requirements, and when NOT to use it.

## Execution strategy

Selects serial vs. subagent-driven execution based on superpowers availability and task complexity. Read [references/execution-strategy.md](references/execution-strategy.md) for the decision tree, detection commands, and worktree-artifact mapping.

## Pre-plan implementation detection

Before creating a plan for a SPEC, scan for evidence that it's already implemented. This avoids re-implementing work that exists on unmerged branches or was done in a prior session. Run these checks in parallel — they're independent signals that feed a single decision.

### Signal scan

| Signal | Check | Why it matters |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Unmerged branches** | `git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:trackshort)' refs/heads/ \| grep -i "<SPEC-ID>"` then verify not merged: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> HEAD` | Worktree branches from prior sessions are the strongest signal — they contain commits that never reached trunk. Discovering this mid-plan-creation is disruptive; catching it here is cheap. |
| **Git history** | `git log --oneline --all \| grep -i "<SPEC-ID>"` | Commits referencing the spec ID indicate implementation happened somewhere in the repo's history. |
| **Deliverable files** | Read the spec to identify described outputs (scripts, modules, configs). Check whether they exist on HEAD via `ls` or Glob. | Files on disk without matching commits may indicate partial or uncommitted work. |
| **Tests pass** | Re-run the spec's tests now and read the output. Prior results are not evidence — only fresh execution counts. | This is the critical gate. Agents are prone to rationalizing that "tests passed before" without re-running. The reason this matters: code changes between sessions can silently break previously-passing tests. |

### Decision

- **2+ signals** → take the retroactive-close path (below)
- **1 signal** → proceed with normal plan creation; note the signal in the first task's description
- **0 signals** → proceed normally

### Retroactive-close path

When evidence confirms prior implementation, skip full task decomposition:

1. Create a single tracking task: `tk create "Retroactive verification: <SPEC-ID>" -t task --external-ref <SPEC-ID> -d "Verify prior implementation before closing SPEC."`
2. Claim it: `tk claim <id>`
3. Run `verification-before-completion` (if superpowers installed) or re-run the spec's tests manually.
4. If verification passes: add a note with the evidence, close the task, then invoke swain-design to transition the spec to Complete.
5. If verification fails: fall back to normal plan creation — the prior implementation was incomplete.

## Worktree isolation preamble

All mutating work tracked by swain-do happens in a worktree — regardless of whether it touches source code, artifacts, skill files, or data. This prevents half-finished changes from polluting trunk and avoids collisions between parallel agents. Before any operation that will produce file changes (plan creation, task claim, code writing, artifact editing, skill file changes, spec transitions, execution handoff), run this detection:

```bash
GIT_COMMON=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null)
GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null)
[ "$GIT_COMMON" != "$GIT_DIR" ] && IN_WORKTREE=yes || IN_WORKTREE=no
```

**Read-only operations skip this check entirely** — proceed in the current context. The explicit read-only allowlist:
- `tk ready`, `tk show`, `tk status`, `tk list`
- `ticket-query` (structured queries)
- Plan inspection (reading plan files without modifying them)
- Status checks and task queries

**If `IN_WORKTREE=yes`:** already isolated. Proceed normally.

**If `IN_WORKTREE=no`** (main worktree) and the operation will produce file changes:

1. **Commit any untracked files before the branch is cut.** A worktree is created from git history — files not yet committed are invisible inside it. This matters for artifacts created moments earlier in the same session (new SPECs, ADRs, etc.). Only untracked files need committing; modified tracked files are already in history and appear in the worktree regardless.
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
   UNTRACKED=$(git -C "$REPO_ROOT" ls-files --others --exclude-standard 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -n "$UNTRACKED" ]; then
     echo "$UNTRACKED" | xargs -d '\n' git -C "$REPO_ROOT" add -- && \
     git -C "$REPO_ROOT" commit -m "chore: stage artifacts before worktree creation" || {
       echo "ERROR: pre-commit step failed — aborting worktree creation"
       exit 1
     }
   fi
   ```
   If the commit fails (e.g., pre-commit hook rejection), surface the error and stop.

2. **Check for existing worktrees** matching the target spec/work:
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
   bash "$REPO_ROOT/.agents/bin/swain-worktree-overlap.sh" "<SPEC-ID>"
   ```
   If the JSON output has `"found": true`, offer to reuse: "Worktree for `<SPEC-ID>` already exists at `<path>`. Reuse it?" If yes, use `EnterWorktree` with the existing branch name. If no, create a new one with a fresh suffix.

3. **Create a new worktree** with a spec-derived name. Use the SPEC ID + slug (e.g., `spec-174-branch-collision`) or generate a timestamped name by running `bash "$REPO_ROOT/.agents/bin/swain-worktree-name.sh" "<context>"` (e.g., output: `session-20260327-143022-a7f3`). Never use a static name like "session" — concurrent sessions will collide. If `EnterWorktree` fails with a branch-exists error, re-run the name script and retry once. This is the only mechanism that actually changes the agent's working directory — manual `git worktree add` + `cd` does not persist across tool calls.

4. After entering, re-run tab naming to reflect the new branch:
   ```bash
   bash "$REPO_ROOT/.agents/bin/swain-tab-name.sh" --path "$(pwd)" --auto
   ```

5. If **`EnterWorktree` fails** — stop. Surface the error to the operator. Do not begin any mutating work.

**Operator override:** If the operator explicitly says "work on trunk" or "don't isolate," respect the override and proceed on trunk. Log a warning: "Proceeding on trunk at operator request — changes will land directly on the development branch."

**Note (SPEC-195):** swain-session no longer creates worktrees at startup — worktree creation is deferred to this preamble, which runs when swain-do dispatches actual work. This ensures worktree names reflect the work context and allows overlap detection.

When all tasks in the plan complete, or when the operator requests, run the plan completion handoff (see below) before exiting the worktree.

## Plan completion and handoff

When all tasks under a plan epic are closed (or the operator declares the work done), execute this chain **before** exiting the worktree. This ensures retros, SPEC transitions, and EPIC cascades fire consistently.

### Step 1 — Detect plan completion

```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
export PATH="$REPO_ROOT/.agents/bin:$PATH"
# Check if any tasks under the plan epic are still open
OPEN_COUNT=$(ticket-query ".parent == \"<epic-id>\" and .status != \"closed\"" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
```

If `OPEN_COUNT > 0`, the plan is not complete — continue working or ask the operator. If `OPEN_COUNT == 0`, proceed.

### Step 2 — Invoke swain-design for SPEC transition

Identify the SPEC linked to the plan epic (via `--external-ref`):

```bash
tk show <epic-id> 2>/dev/null  # external_ref field contains the SPEC ID
```

Invoke **swain-design** to transition the SPEC forward. The target phase depends on the spec's current state and whether verification is complete:
- If all acceptance criteria have evidence → transition to `Complete`
- If acceptance criteria need manual verification → transition to `Needs Manual Test`
- If implementation is done but untested → transition to `In Progress` (if not already)

swain-design handles the downstream chain automatically:
- Checks whether the parent EPIC should also transition (all child SPECs complete → EPIC Complete)
- If the EPIC reaches a terminal state → invokes **swain-retro** to capture the retrospective

### Step 3 — Offer merge and cleanup

After the SPEC transition completes, offer to merge and clean up:

> All tasks closed. SPEC-NNN transitioned to {phase}. Merge this branch into {base-branch} and clean up the worktree?

If the operator accepts:
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Call `ExitWorktree` to return to the main checkout
3. The worktree cleanup is handled by the ExitWorktree tool

If the operator declines, call `ExitWorktree` without merging — the branch is preserved for later.

**Note (ADR-015):** `.tickets/` files in the worktree are ephemeral scaffolding and should not block removal. When ExitWorktree warns about uncommitted files that are only tickets, it is safe to proceed with `discard_changes: true` — tickets have no archival value after SPEC completion.

### Skipping the chain

The operator can say "just exit" or "skip the handoff" to bypass steps 2–3 and go directly to `ExitWorktree`. Log a note on the plan epic: `tk add-note <epic-id> "Exited worktree without completion handoff"`.

## Fallback

If `tk` cannot be found or is unavailable:

1. Log the failure reason.
2. Fall back to a neutral text task ledger (JSONL or Markdown checklist) in the working directory.
3. Use the same status model (`open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `closed`) and keep updates externally visible.
